  [Inhaling and exhaling deeply]

   [Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.

   Speed. I am speed.

   [Cars whizzing past]

   One winner, 42 losers.

   I eat losers for breakfast.

   [Car accelerating]

   Breakfast.

   Wait, maybe I

   should have had breakfast.

   A little breck-y could be good for me.

   No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

   [Cars whizzing]

   I'm faster than fast.

   Quicker than quick.

   I am lightning!

   [Pounding on door]

   [Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?

   [Sheryl Crow:
   Real Gone]

   Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

   [engine rewing]

   [Engine revs]

   [Crowd cheers]

   Ka-chow!

   [Cars zooming]

   Cars.

   [Cars whooshing]

   [Both scream]

   [All cheer]

   Get your antenna balls here!

   Go, Lightnin'!

   - Whoo!

   - You got that right, slick. [whistles]

   [Air wrench whirring]

   Uh! [screams]

   [Engine revs]

   - [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

   - [Crowd cheers]

   I'm Bob Cutlass, here

   with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

   We're midway through what may

   be an historic day for racing.

   Bob, my oil pressure's

   through the roof.

   If this gets more exciting, they're

   gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

   Right, Darrell.

   [Bob] Three cars are tied

   for the season points lead,

   heading into the final race

   of the season.

   And the winner of this race will win

   the season title and the Piston Cup.

   Does The King, Strip Weathers,

   have one more victory in him

   before retirement?

   [Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy

   for years!

   Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

   [Bob] And, as always, in the

   second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

   He's been chasing

   that tailfin his entire career.

   [Darrell] Chick thought

   this was his year.

   His chance to finally emerge

   from The King's shadow.

   But the last thing he expected was...

   Lightning McQueen!

   [Bob] You know, I don't think

   anybody expected this.

   The rookie sensation

   came into the season unknown.

   But everyone knows him now.

   [Darrell] Will he be the first rookie

   to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

   [Bob] The legend, the runner-up,

   and the rookie!

   Three cars, one champion!

   [Breaks screeching]

   No you don't.

   - [Chuckling]

   - Hey!

   - [Tires squealing]

   - [Crowd booing]

   What a ride!

   [Chuckling]

   Go get 'em, McQueen!

   Go get 'em!

   [Female] I love you, Lightning!

   - Dinoco is all mine.

   - [Screaming]

   [Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

   - Get through that, McQueen.

   - [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

   [Crowd gasps]

   [Screaming]

   [Giggling]

   - [Grunts]

   - [Gasps]

   [Both screaming]

   [Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.

   McQueen is in the wreckage.

   [Darrell] There's no way the rookie

   can make it through!

   Not in one piece, that is.

   [Exhaling]

   Yeah!

   Lightning! Oh!

   [Darrell] Look at that!

   McQueen made it through!

   [Bob] A spectacular move

   by Lightning McQueen!

   Yeah! Ka-chow!

   McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

   McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

   Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

   [Bob] While everyone

   heads into the pits,

   McQueen stays out to take the lead!

   Don't take me out, coach.

   I can still race!

   [Air wrench whirring]

   [Chuckling] What do you think?

   A thing of beauty.

   - McQueen made it!

   - [Chick] What?

   He's not pitting!

   You gotta get me out there!

   Let's go! Get me back out there!

   McQueen's not going into the pits!

   [Darrell] The rookie fired his

   crew chief. The third this season!

   - [Bob] Says he likes working alone.

   - Go, go!

   Looks like Chick

   got caught up in the pits.

   Yeah, after a stop like that,

   he's got a lot of ground to make up.

   Get ready, boys,

   we're coming to the restart!

   [Crowd cheers]

   Come on, come on, come on!

   We need tires now!

   Come on, let's go!

   - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!

   - [Male] What?

   You need tires, you idiot!
  </p>
   </div>
   <div id="content-box">
     <h1 id="box2">box 2</h1>
  <p>
     [Darrell] Looks like it's

     gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

     [Bob] Right. No tires again.

     [Darrell] That's a short-term gain,

     long-term loss,

     but it's workin' for him. He obviously

     knows somethin' we don't know.

     [Cars whizzing]

     [Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go

     and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

     He's got it in the bag.

     Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

     We're gonna crown us a new champion!

     [Crowd cheers and whistles]

     [Screaming]

     - Checkered flag, here I come!

     - [Tire blows]

     [Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

     [Bob] And with only one turn to go!

     Can he make it?

     - You fool!

     - [Grunts]

     [Male] McQueen's blown a tire!

     He's blown a tire!

     Go, go, go!

     - [Grunting]

     - [Tire blows]

     [Darrell] He's lost another tire!

     - King and Chick come up fast!

     - [Bob] They're entering turn three!

     Come on. [grunting]

     I don't believe

     what I'm watching, Bob!

     Lightning McQueen

     is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

     [Gasping]

     [Growling]

     [Bob] The King and Chick

     rounding turn four.

     [Darrell] Down the stretch they come!

     And it's, and it's...

     - It's too close to call! Too close!

     - I don't believe it!

     Lightning!

     - The most spectacular, amazing...

     - I don't believe it!

     ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending

     in the history of the world!

     - And we don't know who won!

     - Look at that!

     [Tape jittering]

     [Slow motion drone]

     - That's very close to call.

     - Can we play that again?

     Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

     We're here in Victory Lane,

     awaiting the results.

     We're here in Victory Lane,

     awaiting the results.

     McQueen, that was a risky move,

     not taking tires.

     Tell me about it!

     Are you sorry you didn't have

     a crew chief out there?

     Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing

     than just winning.

     I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
  </p>
   </div>
   <div id="content-box">
    <h1 id="box3">box 3</h1>
    <p>
    Where's the entertainment in that?

    I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

    - Sizzle?

    - Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

    No, I'm not.

    'Cause I'm a one-man show.

    What? Oh, yeah, right.

    That was a confident

    Lightning McQueen.

    Live from Victory Lane,

    I'm Kori Turbowitz.

    - Get outta the shot.

    - Yo, Chuck.

    Chuck, what are you doing?

    You're blockin' the camera!

    - Everyone wants to see the bolt.

    - What?

    - Now, back away.

    - That's it! Come on, guys.

    - Whoa, team! Where are you going?

    - We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

    Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

    How will I ever find anyone else

    who knows how to fill me up with gas?

    [Crowd laughs]

    - Adios, Chuck!

    - And my name is not Chuck!

    Oh, whatever.

    Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

    Seriously, that was some

    pretty darn nice racin' out there.

    - By me!

    - Oh, yeah.

    - Zinger!

    - Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

    The Piston Cup...

    It's mine, dude. It's mine.

    Hey, fellas, how do you think

    I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

    In your dreams, Thunder.

    Yeah, right. Thunder?

    What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

    You know, 'cause thunder

    always comes after lightning.

    Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

    - Who knew about the thunder thing?

    - I didn't.

    - Give us the bolt!

    - That's right.

    Right in the lens.

    - Show me the bolt, baby!

    - Smile, McQueen!

    - Show me the bolt, McQueen!

    - That's it!

    [Electronic music]

    [Crowd chattering]

    That was one close finish.

    You sure made Dinoco proud.

    Thank you, King.

    Well, Tex, you've been

    good to me all these years.

    It's the least I could do.

    Whatever happens, you're a winner

    to me, you old daddy rabbit.

    Thanks, dear.

    Wouldn't be nothing without you.

    Kch-i-ka-chow!

    - I'm Mia.

    - I'm Tia.

    [Both] We're, like, your biggest fans!

    Ka-chow!

    I love being me.

    - [Police] OK, girls, that's it.

  - We love you, Lightning!

  [Chuckles]

  Hey, buddy.

  You're one gutsy racer.

  Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

  You got more talent in one lug nut

  than a lot of cars has got

  in their whole body.

  - Really? Oh, that...

  - But you're stupid.

  - Excuse me?

  - This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

  You need to wise up and get

  a good crew chief and a good team.

  You ain't gonna win

  unless you got good folks behind you,

  [voice dwindling] and you let them

  do their job, like they should.

  - Like I tell the boys at the shop...

  - A good team.

  - Yeah...

  - [electronic music]

  Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

  [Crowd cheering]

  [Screaming]

  [Cheering]

  Oh, Lightning!

  If you figure that out

  you just gonna be OK.

  Oh, yeah, that...

  That is spectacular advice.

  Thank you, Mr. The King.

  - [Fanfare]

  - [Bob] Ladies and gentlemen,

  for the first time

  in Piston Cup history...

  [rewing] A rookie

  has won the Piston Cup.

  Yes!

  [Bob]... we have a three-way tie.

  - [Crowd cheers]

  - [Cameras flash]

  [Chuckling] Hey,

  that must be really embarrassing.

  But I wouldn't worry about it.

  Because I didn't do it!

  [Bob] Piston Cup officials

  have determined that a tiebreaker race

  between the three leaders

  will be held in California in one week.

  Well, thank you! Thanks to

  all of you out there! Thank you!

  [Whispering] Hey, first one to

  California gets Dinoco all to himself.

  No, not me!

  No, you rock, and you know that!

  Oh, yeah! Whoo!

  Yep! All right! Got it!

  "First one to California

  gets Dinoco all to himself."

  Oh, we'll see

  who gets there first, Chick.

  Huh?

  - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.

  - I don't want to talk about it.

  Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.

  What'd you do with my trailer?

  - I parked it at your sponsor's tent.

  - What?

  Gotta make your personal appearance.

  No. No! No, no, no, no!
</p>
   </div>
   <div id="content-box">
  <h1 id="box5">box 5</h1>
<p>
  Yes, yes, yes!

  Lightning McQueen here.

  And I use Rust-eze Medicated

  Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

  Nothing soothes a rusty bumper

  like Rust-eze.

  Wow! Look at that shine!

  Use Rust-eze and you too

  can look like me!

  Ka-chow!

  [Both laughing]

  I met this car from Swampscott.

  He was so rusty

  he didn't even cast a shadow.

  - You could see his dirty undercarriage.

  - [Crowd laughs]

  [Groaning] I hate rusty cars.

  This is not good for my image.

  They did give you your big break.

  Besides, it's in your contract.

  Oh, will you stop, please?

  Just go get hooked up.

  - Winter is a grand old time.

  - Of this there are no ifs or buts.

  [Male 1] But remember,

  all that salt and grime...

  Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

  Hey, look! There he is!

  Our almost champ!

  [Male 1] Get your rear end in here.

  Lightning McQueen,

  you are wicked fast!

  - That race was a pisser!

  - You were booking!

  - Give me a little room.

  - You're my hero!

  Yes, I know. [chuckles]

  "Fred." Fred, thank you.

  He knows my name.

  He knows my name!

  Looking good, Freddie!

  Thanks to you, Lightning,

  we had a banner year!

  We might clear enough

  to buy you some headlights.

  You saying he doesn't have headlights?

  That's what I'm telling ya.

  They're stickers!

  Well, you know,

  racecars don't need headlights,

  because the track is always lit.

  Yeah, well, so is my brother,

  but he still needs headlights.

  [Laughing]

  [Forced laughter]

  - Ladies and gentlemen,

  - [both] Lightning McQueen!

  [Crickets chirping]

  Free Bird!

  You know, the Rust-eze Medicated

  Bumper Ointment team

  ran a great race today.

  And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

  [whispering] And an insane

  amount of luck,

  ...you too, can look like me.

  Ka-chow.

  - Hey, kid.

  - We love ya.

  And we're looking forward
